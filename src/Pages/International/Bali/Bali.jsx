              <strong>Bali â€“ "The Island of the Gods"</strong> is rightly the
              most popular tourist destination in Indonesia. It's the
              quintessential tropical paradise. Every day small offerings of
              flowers and burning incense sticks are left outside the hotels,
              bars and restaurants on the island. The gentle sound of a gong
              signals the passing of a parade of Balinese dressed in white
              robes. It is this rich culture, which has been enchanting tourists
              who come to the island for the last few hundred years.

              Leaving the city behind you are quickly surrounded by paddy fields
              and thickly forested hills. The roads lead you through small
              villages and isolated temples perched on the slopes of the hills,
              the perfect place for a bicycle tour. In the highlands, there are
              dozens of tumbling waterfalls where you can go for a swim, which
              lead into the rushing rivers where people go white water rafting.
              Or if you're feeling adventurous you can spend your time jumping
              off waterfalls and abseiling on a day of canyoning.

              Among thousands of islands that make up the Republic of Indonesia.
              In the midst of the most populous Islamic country in the world,
              this small island has remained predominantly Hindu. A thousand
              years ago many people practised Hinduism across Southeast Asia.
              Today Bali is the only place in the entire region where these
              once-widespread traditions remain strong.

              <p>
                The best time to visit Bali is between April and October, the
                island's dry season. Bali experiences only two seasons: the
                rainy season and the dry season.
