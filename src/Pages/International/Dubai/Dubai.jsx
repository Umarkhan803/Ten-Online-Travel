            Flaunting its glittering infrastructure amid the glorious Arabian
            desert, the city of Dubai was once known to be a barren land. Today,
            this man-made miracle is filled with shimmering skyscrapers, fancy
            hotels, shopping malls and restaurants. Burj Khalifa â€“ the tallest
            manmade building, Dubai Fountain with jets and lights choreographed
            to music, Atlantis, the Palm and an aquarium resort are among the
            top tourist destinations in Dubai. With the biggest population of
            all the seven emirates and the second largest in size, Dubai will
            overwhelm you with its amalgamation of futuristic marvel and ancient
            Arabian traditions.
